# Project Implementation Plan for IT Job Search Platform

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for developing the IT job search platform, including development phases, timeline, resource allocation, and risk management.

## 1. Project Overview

The IT job search platform is a web application designed for the Ukrainian IT market, connecting job seekers with employers. The platform follows the SLC (Simple, Lovable, Complete) format, providing an intuitive interface and key features for HR professionals and job seekers.

### Key Objectives

- Create a user-friendly platform for IT job search and recruitment
- Implement core features for job posting, resume creation, and application management
- Develop a robust search system with filtering capabilities
- Build a secure authentication and authorization system
- Implement a messaging system for communication between users
- Create an admin dashboard for platform management
- Integrate payment processing for job posting fees

## 2. Development Approach

We will follow an Agile development methodology with two-week sprints. The development will be divided into phases, with each phase focusing on specific features and functionality.

### Development Principles

- **User-Centric Design**: Focus on user experience and intuitive interfaces
- **Iterative Development**: Build incrementally with regular feedback
- **Quality Assurance**: Implement testing at all levels (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- **Security First**: Prioritize security in all aspects of development
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure fast load times and responsive interfaces
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines for accessibility

### Development Environment

- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub for source code management
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment
- **Development**: Local development environments with Docker
- **Staging**: Staging environment for testing before production
- **Production**: Production environment for the live application

## 3. Project Phases and Timeline

The project is estimated to take approximately 21 weeks (5 months) to complete, divided into the following phases:
